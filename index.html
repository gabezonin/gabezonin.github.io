  <h1>Chemistry of Pizza</h1>
	<h2>How We Got to the Modern Pizza</h2>
 <h2>Summary</h2>
	<p>The city of Naples thrived during the Eighteenth and Nineteenth centuries. The working poor class was known for living in dense populations, especially near the Gulf of Naples. The need for inexpensive food was necessary for these people. The rise of vendors selling flatbreads with toppings grew in these areas. In these days, toppings included tomatoes, cheese, olive oil, garlic, and more. </p>
    	<h2>Pizza Timeline</h2>
  <h3>Before First Century B.C.</h3>
   <p>Darius the Great had written about baking flatbreads on soldier’s shield and covering it with cheese and dates. This is considered the earliest written mention of pizza. In 300 BC, Marcus Porcius Cato also mentioned a version of pizza, which featured flat dough topped with olive oil, honey, and herbs. Likewise, the Roman poet Virgil discussed pizza-like food in his poem, “The Aeneid.”</p>
   <p>Archaeologists have even found shops from the ruins of Pompeii that were used for the sale and creation of pizzas. These archaeologists have suggested that Pompeii developed the need for pizza similar to that of Naples (in which it was sold inexpensively so that the large populations could consume it), which was nearby.</p>
  <h3>Sixteenth Century A.D.</h3>
   <p>In 1522, tomatoes were first imported to Europe from the newly discovered New World. Naples, Italy is credited with first combining tomatoes with the flatbreads and existing toppings, including olive oil, herbs, and cheese. As a major port and center of Italy, international sailors learned of the food and spread the dish over Europe. It quickly gained popularity, and tourists rushed to try the new dish in Naples. The Queen of Naples, Queen Maria Carolina d’Asburgo Lorena, even had a special oven in her palace used specifically to make pizzas.</p>
  <h3>Nineteenth Century A.D.</h3>
   <p>Neapolitans consumed pizza at most meals, leading to the rise in new and interesting toppings. Pizza establishments were built, and named pizzeras. The first modern pizzeria opened in Naples in 1830 under the name of Antica Pizzeria Port’Alba. In 1889, the King and Queen of Italy ordered Raffaele Esposito (famed Naples pizza chef) to create pizzas for them. The King and Queen showered Esposito in great praise, and his designs were featured as the standard for the future of the pizza.</p>
   <p>One of the pizzas Raffaele Esposito created for the King and Queen of Italy included tomatoes, mozzarella cheese, and basil. This was to represent the flag of Italy. Queen Margherita enjoyed this pizza so much that she sent a letter to Esposito to commend his dish. His restaurant, now called Pizzaria di Brandi, still has the letter from the Queen displayed. The pizza that Esposito gave the Queen to try was even called “Pizza Margherita.”</p>
  <h3>Early Twentieth Century</h3>
   <p>America saw the first Italian pizza in Chicago. Vendors would sell them on the streets to pedestrians on Taylor Street. The first license for baking pizzas in America was granted to Gennaro Lombardi, an Italian immigrant, in New York City. Many famous pizzerias opened between 1910 and 1925, from Famous Joe’s Tomato Pies to Totonno’s Pizzeria.</p>
  <h3>Mid-Twentieth Century to Present</h3>
   <p>In 1943, Ike Sewell invents the Chicago-style deep-dish pizza, which features a crust that rises at least an inch above the plate and creates a well for toppings. Pizza saw a huge popularity boost with famous celebrities starting to support it; in 1957, the first supermarket pizza was manufactured with great success.</p>
   <p>Many famous and modern pizza chains opened during this time, from Pizza Hut in 1958 to Domino’s in 1967 to Papa John’s in 1984. The next mind-blowing pizza revelation was the development of “self-rising” crust. This revelation was discovered by Kraft in 1995.</p>
