  <h1>Ingredient Chemistry</h1>
   <p>There are four main ingredients when making pizza. These include:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Dough</li>
    <li>Sauce</li>
    <li>Cheese</li>
    <li>Topping(s)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This page will delve into the variances of these ingredients, as well as the uses of each.</p>

    <th>Pizza dough is created from warm water, flour, and yeast. This mixture is kneaded for about five to ten minutes and is rolled out to a desirable circumference.</p>
  <h3>How does this taste so good?</h3>
   <p>Yeast (which is actually unicellular fungus of the name <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> is activated from the warm water. The yeast consumes the sugars in flour, and releases carbon dioxide. This causes the dough to rise and taste delicious!</p></th>
    <th>Pizza sauce can be manifested from a variety of bases. The most common and popular sauce base is tomato. This gives the pizza the classic red look. Alternatives for tomato sauce include pesto, bechamel, alfredo sauce, and more.</p>
  <h3>How does this work?</h3>
   <p>The key to the tomato sauce is the fluidity. Classic pizzas that feature tomato sauce are a mixture of tomato paste and tomato sauce. A thin sauce will spread too much and will not be appealing, but a sauce that is thick enough will be rich and juicy. The key to this is the tomato paste.</p>
  <h3>Note</h3>
   <p>Tomatoes are acidic and usually fall between 4.0 and 4.6 on the pH scale. Consuming too much pizza may result in acid reflux and it will be hard to consume acidic foods, including pizza. Some people neutralize the acidity in pizza by adding a teaspoon of baking soda into the sauce.</p></th> 
    <th>Cheese is the glue of the pizza. The cheese holds the other ingredients together and provides moisture in the pizza. The most popular cheese to use is mozzarella, and other popular cheeses include ricotta, feta, parmesan, and cheddar. When cheeses are melted on a pizza, the stringy quality is present, holding the pizza together and allowing for the cheesiness pizza lovers enjoy and seek out.</p>
  <h3>Why is mozzarella cheese so popular on pizza?</h3>
   <p>Mozzarella cheese is a very moist and soft cheese, best eaten fresh. Mozzarella cheese contains casein proteins, which are proteins found in mammalian milk and are good at binding compounds. In terms of pizza, the casein is necessary. When the pizza is cooked, the fats the cheeses liquify and retain moisture in the rest of the pizza ingredients. Meanwhile, calcium ions hold the casein proteins together so that the proteins do not denature.</p></th>
    <th>Toppings are the most diverse part of a pizza. This can make the pizza meaty, vegetarian, fruity, fishy, or a mixture of all! These are no limits on what you can put on as a topping, and there are no limits as to how many! Typically, there are a few categories of toppings: vegetables, nuts, meats, and seafood. Some chefs will add herbs and spices as a garnish as well.</p>
  <h3>Do toppings add anything to a pizza in terms of chemistry?</h3>
   <p><b>Yes! </b>Pizza toppings add another component of flavor. The maillard reaction goes into more information about this phenomenon. In short, toppings help retain moisture, and control the baking of the crust.</p>
  <h3>What are some popular topping combinations?</h3>
   <ul>
   <li><b>Supreme:</b> Pepperoni, Sausage, Mushrooms, Pepper, and Olives</li>
   <li><b>Meat Lovers:</b> Sausage, Pork, Beef, Pepperoni, Bacon, and Ham</li>
   <li><b>Vegetarian:</b> Mushrooms, Green Peppers, Onions, and Olives</li>
   <li><b>Mediterranean: </b> Artichokes, Ham, Olives, Feta, and Tomatoes</li></th>
