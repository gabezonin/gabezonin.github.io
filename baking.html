 <h1>Chemistry of Pizza</h1>
 <h2>The Baking Process</h2>
  <p>The baking process of pizza is crucial. The cheese melts, the flavors mature, and the dough cooks to have a crunchy outside and soft inside. Several processes and reactions are involved in the baking process.</p>
 <h3>Ingredients and Chemical Structure</h3>
  <ul>
   <li>Flour<img src="/WebDesignPictures/Flour.bmp" alt="Flour Chemical Composition"></li>
   <li>Water</li>
   <li>Salt</li>
   <li>Yeast</li>
   <li>Tomatoes</li>
   <li>Cheese</li>
   <li>Garlic</li>
   <li>Oregano</li>
   <li>Olive Oil</li>
  </ul>
 <h3>Making Pizza</h3>
  <p>Pizza dough begins as a mix of salt, yeast, flour, water. When these ingredients are mixed together, single-celled fungi in the form of yeast leave their dormancy and begin to break down the complex sugars found in the dough. This process of fermentation releases carbon dioxide and causes the dough to aerate and rise. The salt in the dough both adds flavor and keeps the dough from rising too quickly.</p>
 <h4>The Maillard Reaction</h4>
  <p>At temperatures above 140 degrees Celsius, sugars and amino acids react to create flavor compounds and adds a bold, cooked flavor to the pie. This is how the crust, cheese, and toppings get the “browned” effect after cooking. The dough, however, is still soft underneath the cheese and sauce and toppings, which creates an exciting mixture of texture when eaten.</p>
